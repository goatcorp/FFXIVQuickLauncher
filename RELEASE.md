This is a maintenance release.

This release is intended to test the update system. Please use a regular release instead.

**:warning: Attention!**
If you receive errors during the installation or if the launcher doesn't work correctly, make sure to check your antivirus first and disable it for XIVLauncher. Many commercial antivirus programs detect XIVLauncher as a false positive. Please also see this FAQ entry with more information: https://goatcorp.github.io/faq/xl_troubleshooting#q-how-do-i-whitelist-xivlauncher-and-dalamud-so-my-antivirus-leaves-them-alone

**Please download ``Setup.exe`` from below to install XIVLauncher, if you have not used it before.**
